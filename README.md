<!--
The Original script.
My name is Michael Sean Brian B. Omisol (or just call me **Omi**). I am an undergraduate student from the [University of the Philippines â€” Diliman](https://up.edu.ph/) as well as a seasoned (_not veteran_) game developer in [RPGMaker](https://rpgmaker.net/users/Vaccaria/)â€”the very place where I started game developing! I have already created a few games under my belt, and have participated in a few collaborative projects outside of game development.

As you've noticed, I am a game developer that has been going in and out of field ever since I have taken my education seriously. I have my own regrets doing so, but I have also learned a few things along the way that has efficiently boosted my abilities as a programmer. While my base profiency lies upon the eponymous RPG Maker software line, I have also been taking a gander towards Godot and Unity.

However, I have also taken into consideration other aspects in the field of computer science. I am particularly interested in Computer Security, AI Development (the safer one, mind you), UI/UX Development as well as Web Development. If you're finding someone willing to learn, then you've got the man right here!

Check out my projects below! You never know if you'll like it until you've tried it.
